# Project-on-Snowflake-AWS

Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering pipeline designed to ingest, process, and store large-scale datasets using AWS services and Snowflake. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to integrate data from various sources, perform data transformations, and manage data in a scalable, efficient, and secure manner. The project makes use of various AWS services like S3, Lambda, and Glue along with Snowflake for data storage, transformation, and analysis.

Prerequisites
To run this project, the following services and tools are required:
•	AWS Account with permissions to use S3, IAM roles and policies and Snowflake integrations.
•	Snowflake Account with access to create databases, schemas, and tables.
•	AWS CLI or AWS Management Console for managing AWS resources.
•	SQL Knowledge for querying data in Snowflake.

Conclusion
This end-to-end data engineering project demonstrates how to build a scalable, automated data pipeline using AWS and Snowflake. It shows how to seamlessly ingest raw data, perform transformations, and load it into a powerful data warehouse for analytics. This project serves as a foundation for building more complex data systems and can be extended to include additional data sources, transformation logic, or reporting capabilities.
